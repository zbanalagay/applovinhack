##Getting Started
To run the server:

```cd server```

```node server.js```

Then, build and run the xcode.

##Sources

I used the following resources for this:

https://www.raywenderlich.com/114886/beginning-tvos-development-with-tvml-tutorial

This tutorial provides a step by step walkthrough of setting up a TVML app.

https://developer.apple.com/library/tvos/samplecode/TVMLCatalog/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016505-Intro-DontLinkElementID_2

This is sample code provided by Apple of a TVML app. It has a very large number of sample TVML templates, and is thus a very good resource.
